<h1>About Us</h1>
<h3>This is a weather forecast app developed by me, available on web. It allows users to see the conditions, temperature, max and min temperature, humidity, wind speed other related metrics of the device's current location, as well as a number of other cities.
    The weather station helped take preventive measures against destructive rains, strong winds, severe high or low temperatures, and pests and diseases. Using a weather station helps you cope with frost and high temperatures in summer.</h3>
